# Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2.0 Lecture Material (January 2020 - April 2020)
**NOTE! THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANSCISCO VERSION** 

This course will run from January 15th until May. This course will be live-streamed on Twitch.TV and then uploaded to YouTube 48 hours later. Each lecture will be between an hour to an hour and 15 minutes, followed by an hour to work on projects related to the course. 

**Requirements**:
* A Google account to utilize Google Colaboratory
* A Paperspace account for Natural Language Processing

The overall schedule is broken up into blocks as such:

**BLOCKS**:
* Block 1: Computer Vision
* Block 2: Tabular Neural Networks
* Block 3: Natural Language Processing

Here is the overall schedule broken down by week:
*This schedule is subject to change*

**Block 1** (January 15th - February 19th):
* Lesson 1: PETs and Custom Datasets (a warm introduction to the DataBlock API)
* Lesson 2: Image Classification Models from Scratch, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Multi-Label Classification, and Dealing with Unknown Labels
* Lesson 3: Image Segmentation, Image Regression, State-of-the-Art in Computer Vision
* Lesson 4: Pose Detection and Style Transfer
* Lesson 5: GAN's
* Lesson 6: Audio, Object Detection

**Block 2** (February 26th - March 18th):
* Lesson 1: Pandas Workshop and Tabular Classification
* Lesson 2: Feature Engineering and Tabular Regression
* Lesson 3: Permutation Importance, Bayesian Optimization, Cross-Validation, and Labeled Test Sets
* Lesson 4: Kaggle Competitions, RAPIDs.AI

**BLOCK 3** (March 25th - April 15th):
* Lesson 1: Introduction to NLP and the LSTM
* Lesson 2: Full Sentiment Classification, Tokenizers, and Ensembling
* Lesson 3: Other State-of-the-Art NLP Models and Multilingual Data
* Lesson 4: DeViSe

We have a Group Study discussion [here] on the Fast.AI forums for discussing this material and asking specific questions.

* NOTE: This course does **not** have a certification or credit. This is something I have been doing for the past few semesters to help branch fellow Undergraduates at my school into the world of fastai, and this year I am making it much more available.
